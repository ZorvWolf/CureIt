CureIt 🧠📱

AI-Powered Android Health Assistant

Overview

CureIt is a private Android application designed to demonstrate real-world mobile development skills, including secure API integration, AI-assisted logic, and modern Android UI practices.

The project focuses on architecture, scalability, and clean networking, making it suitable for technical evaluation and interviews rather than public distribution.

Purpose

This repository exists for:

📌 Portfolio & interview discussion

📌 Demonstrating Android + API integration knowledge

📌 Showcasing clean engineering practices

⚠️ This is not an open-source project.
Source code, API keys, and internal logic are intentionally restricted.

Core Capabilities

🤖 AI-based request processing via external APIs

🌐 Secure REST API communication

⚡ Efficient background networking

🎨 Modern Android UI implementation

🔐 Secure handling of sensitive credentials

🧩 Modular and maintainable code design

Technology Stack
Android

Java & Kotlin

AndroidX ecosystem

Target SDK: 34

Gradle (modern build system)

Networking

Retrofit

OkHttp

JSON serialization (Gson / Moshi)

AI / Cloud

AI service integration (OpenRouter / OpenAI / Gemini-style APIs)

Dedicated API client and service abstraction layer

UI

Material Design

DataBinding / ViewBinding

Architecture (High Level)

UI layer communicates with a service layer

Service layer handles:

API requests

Response parsing

Error handling

No direct API logic inside UI components

Clear separation of concerns for maintainability

Security Considerations

🔒 API keys are masked and excluded from public visibility

🔒 No sensitive credentials committed

🔒 Designed to support secure key storage or backend token proxy

🔒 Network requests handled through a centralized client

Interview Explanation (Short)

“CureIt is a private Android application that integrates AI APIs using Retrofit and OkHttp, applies clean separation between UI and networking layers, and follows secure credential-handling practices. It’s built to demonstrate real-world Android architecture rather than being an open-source release.”

Status

🚧 Private Project
Not intended for public builds, forks, or redistribution.
